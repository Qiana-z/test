The TNFD recommendations are consistent with global policy goals and international sustainability reporting standards, are science based, and designed to allow organisations across jurisdictions to get started now and increase their disclosure ambition over time. There is no single way to get started with the TNFD recommendations, as each organisation is different and will therefore have its own pathway towards adoption. But, as with every path, taking the first step is the most important. This guidance includes a set of key steps that your organisation should consider when getting started, and advice on how to address some of the practicalities when preparing to assess and disclose across the TNFD’s four disclosure pillars. This guidance should be used in combination with the TNFD’s Recommendations and suite of Additional Guidance."}

For large companies and financial institutions, adoption of the TNFD recommendations will allow them to align fully with requirements to assess and disclose their nature-related risks, impacts and dependencies by 2030 in the corporate reporting target (Target 15) of the GBF. The degradation of nature and actions aimed at conserving, restoring and sustainably using it present significant risks and opportunities for business, finance and society , both now and in the future. Despite their economic and financial importance, few organisations have been systematically assessing and disclosing their nature-related issues (dependencies, impacts, risks and opportunities). In the past, this has largely been due to the lack of requirements from governments and market regulators and the limited availability of, and understanding about, nature-related tools, metrics and data. However , both of these are changing rapidly ."}

But a similar level of consistency and maturity of an equivalent language system for nature has not developed across business and finance.

Having made the business case, it will be important to engage with the board and management to obtain a commitment to adopt the TNFD recommendations. This commitment will require sufficient, necessary and timely information on nature-related issues provided to the board and management.

{"chapter": "However , most organisations will likely need to", "word_count": 517, "content": "collect new information across their business model and value chains to be able to adopt all the TNFD recommendations. At the initial stage, your organisation can get started with those nature-related issues it identifies as most material. The LEAP approach is a practical guide for all organisations on how these issues can be scanned and triaged, even with limited internal data and knowledge. Following this approach will help identify which issues, in the first instance, should be considered for reporting against TNFD recommended disclosures. As highlighted by the TCFD reporting experience and the TNFD survey insights outlined above, material nature-related issues will vary by organisation, sector , biome and region. 2023 144. Plan for progression over time and communicate your plans and approach Expanding the depth and breadth of your TNFD-aligned disclosures over time is important. Your organisation may build its progression plan, for example, by choosing to focus on a specific business line, geography or impact driver to make in-depth disclosures and then expanding the scope. The TNFD Recommendations ask report preparers to describe the scope of their disclosures at the outset so that a limited scope of reporting will be clear to report users. Your organisation should form a plan to produce TNFD- aligned disclosures and expand the scope over time. This plan could consist of goals by specific dates (for example, within the next X years), or be based on a set of conditions (for example, when data Y can be sourced). This plan could be improved by including other elements, such as the expected resource and capacity building needs, and the relationship with other sustainability-related work, on climate, for example, and the disclosure standards landscape. It might also include how TNFD-aligned disclosures would support other elements of your organisation’s agenda and strategy. There is merit in publicly communicating these plans to help manage the expectations of your report users. This could cover your organisation’s expected pathway to ensure greater depth and breadth of TNFD-aligned disclosures over time. It could also include the current status of your organisation’s TCFD-aligned disclosures, and any plans to leverage this work for TNFD adoption and integrated climate- and nature-related disclosures. 5. Encourage collective progress through engagement The progress of your organisation’s TNFD-aligned disclosures will be influenced by the progress of others. Specifically, the ability of any one organisation to identify , assess and disclose its nature-related issues will depend to an extent on the understanding, plans and ambition of its relevant stakeholders. For example, most of the potentially material nature-related issues for global financial institutions and large multinational corporates will be in their financed activities or value chains and not in their direct operations. Engagement with relevant organisations to encourage them to assess nature-related issues will therefore be critical for these organisations. To support their own progress towards adopting TNFD’s recommendations, organisations should encourage their relevant stakeholders to advance their own understanding, identification and assessment of nature- related issues. For example, corporates can establish and maintain regular dialogues and agree areas of focus with organisations along their value chains to improve the traceability and visibility of nature-related issues."}

Similar actions are happening in other areas of sustainability disclosures.

Annual reporting is a reasonable default, but the timing will ultimately be determined by your organisation, in consultation with key internal stakeholders, such as the board and management.

This can build an understanding of the benefits and limitations of any given method, and how its results should be interpreted. As part of this identification, your organisation should consider how it would employ a given assessment method and understand whether it has the required internal skills and systems or needs to source external support. Many organisations, particularly financial institutions, will find heatmapping a useful and accessible way to start as: • It is analogous to similar approaches used for climate- related risk assessment; • It can make use of a sectoral approach for which data gathering is generally less challenging than counterparty-based assessments; and • It often refers to ready-made impact and dependency materiality scoring made by third parties, which can be developed further , with judgment. 2023 20When getting started with scenario analysis, your organisation should treat this as an iterative process, which initially may be more qualitative than quantitative, and only focus on specific business units, sectors, regions or biomes."}

When getting started with nature-related disclosure metrics, your organisation should seek to familiarise itself with and build an understanding of the TNFD’s core and additional disclosure metrics. Your organisation should also plan to expand the content and scope of metrics it seeks to report on over time, including forward- looking indicators."}

Your organisation will also need to consider how it plans to monitor and assess progress against a chosen target before deciding to implement it. In addition, you should also identify any climate-related targets adopted, or planned to be adopted, and consider the interactions with potential nature-related targets."}
